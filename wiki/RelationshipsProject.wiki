= Introduction =
Tracking relationships between people is how a social graph can be created in the nonprofit starter pack.

= Current State = 
The Relationships package allows for the relating of two Contacts to each other. Metadata about the relationship inludes Type, Status and description. Because this object has 2 relationships to Contact, it would have two related lists. To get around this confusion, Apex creates 2 records for each relationship and links them together. This is implemented along the lines of the Partner object.

= Problems with current State =

 * There is no directionality of Relationships--it is impossible to say one Contact referred another, for example
