= Introduction =

Salesforce.com can easily be filled with duplicate data, either because of user error or web-to-lead activities. The platform has an interface for merging Contacts in the same Account. It allows you to paint a perfect record and then merge the Contacts, automatically reparenting the children.

= Current State = 

The one-to-one Account model currently does not work with the standard Salesforce merge so we built an interface to allow for finding Contacts and merging them.

= Problems with current State =

 * the merge interface doesn't allow for painting a perfect record
 * usability and visual quality of the interface is less than ideal
 * not all fields are shown in the merge interface
 * Users cannot control the fields that are shown in the merge interface

= Potential Course of Action =

  * Modify the Merge interface for better usability and visual appeal
  * allow for viewing all relevant Contact fields
  * build a paint-a-perfect record interface

== Impact on current install base ==

= Pros and Cons of Course of Action =
